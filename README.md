# SMSClassifierJava


Hi! This is a simple SMS Classifier I made in Java using Weka.
It can detect whether a message is spam or ham using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## What it does
- Loads and preprocesses a dataset of SMS messages
- Trains a Naive Bayes model
- Evaluates how well the model performs
- Lets you test new messages to see if they are spam or not

## How to run
1. Make sure you have Java 21 installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
4. Run the `App.java` class.

## Notes
- This is my first try at a machine learning project in Java, so itâ€™s basic but works!
- The dataset I used is called `SMSSpamCollection`.
- Warnings might appear in the console, but the program should still run.
